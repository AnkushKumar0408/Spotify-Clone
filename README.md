# Spotify-Clone

So guys this is 22nd project of my 25 days frontend project challenge.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project.

All the Buttons are working, play, pause, forward and backward buttonts are clickable.

All these things are possible dure to JavaScript. 

addEventlistner function of JavaScript plays important role in it so must check JavaScript part.
